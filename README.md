Little Ant game for learning 

11/21/17
Ok soooo I made my first website in 1998 and it when from there...now it has been two or three years since I looked into web design and I have learned so much has changed, in some aspects it is more complex but yet easier at the same time...but still will take time to get updated. Thus far I am looking at different webhosting site that DO NOT use a website builder tools (heroku or firebase for backend and github pages for front end...maybe)
